## Retro Blade 
In "Retro Blade," a thrilling 2D indie game inspired by classic Nintendo titles from the 90s, players embark on an action-packed adventure filled with sword-wielding excitement. As they take control of a courageous main character, they'll utilize their projectile-based sword attacks to vanquish a variety of enemies.

The game features an array of challenging foes, each with different levels of difficulty. Players must employ their strategic skills and precise aiming to eliminate these adversaries by landing successful projectile hits. However, the journey becomes even more perilous as certain enemies retaliate by shooting projectiles back at the player, intensifying the battle.

As the main character progresses through the game, they must manage their health wisely. With a total of four health points, players must be cautious and strategic, as falling below three health points transforms their projectiles into powerful sword attacks, adding an additional layer of complexity and risk.

The pinnacle of the game awaits players in the form of a formidable final boss. This boss relentlessly unleashes projectiles from all sides in a chaotic and random fashion, testing the player's agility and reflexes. To emerge victorious, players must strike the boss with precision, landing four decisive blows to secure victory and bring an end to this thrilling adventure.

With its nostalgic pixel art style, challenging gameplay, and homage to classic Nintendo games, "Retro Blade" delivers an engaging and action-packed experience that will captivate fans of retro-inspired gaming. Are you ready to wield your blade and face the challenges that lie ahead?
